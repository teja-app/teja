# This is the process that would make it easier.

## 1. Start from the API


### 1.1 Prompt

> This is the API Client Implement for Flutter, can you implemented the featured {feature_name} API, DTO and Entity in a similar way
```{Entire Module of Nest.js or the API which is implemented would be better}```
```{Provide the files of API DTO and Entity too}```

**Generated File:** 

[API Example](/lib/infrastructure/api/featured_journal_template_api.dart)
[Entity Example](/lib/domain/entities/featured_journal_template_entity.dart)
[DTO Example](/lib/infrastructure/dto/featured_journal_template_dto.dart)

### 1.2 Build the DTO:
`flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-output`


## 2. Let's Build the Redux Actions and States without an store

### 2.1  Prompt

> Based on the {API Genereated Above} and the example of the {Example Code Given below} given below create similar actions, reducer, saga and state for the {Your Saga Name}

**Note:** This should generate all the code for Redux, but since you might have given a saga which have repository it can give you the code with repository.

Generated Folder
+ `lib/domain/redux/journal/featured_journal_template`

### 2.2 Modifying Sagas, Reducers and States to App

[State](/lib/domain/redux/app_state.dart)
[Reducer](/lib/domain/redux/app_reducer.dart)
[Root Saga](/lib/domain/redux/root_saga.dart)


### 2.3 Restart App from CLI

`Cmd+C` - Closing the application ðŸ¤ª


## 3. Implementing the Frontend

### 3.1. Call the API 

+ In [Onboarding](/lib/presentation/onboarding/pages/onboarding_page.dart)
+ Anywhere you prefer where it's needed

### 3.2. Implement the ViewModel

+ Implement the state ViewModel to implement the consumption of the state. Example [ExplorePageViewModel in explorepage](/lib/presentation/explore/list/pages/explore_page.dart)
+ Consume like on [Explore Page in ExplorePageState](/lib/presentation/explore/list/pages/explore_page.dart)


## 4. Implemenation of Hive or Isar

Since most of the application is built with offline first and journaling is needed even in the most remote locations.
We have focused on storing the data in Hive or Isar.

Hive is a great persistance store to get started.

##### 4.1 For Hive

Copy these 2 files.

[Constants](/lib/infrastructure/database/hive_collections/constants.dart)
[Hive Collection](/lib/infrastructure/database/hive_collections/featured_journal_template.dart)
